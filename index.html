            <h1>Can The Red Sox Make The Playoffs?</h1>
            <p>At the current moment, the Red Sox are 4.5 games back of a playoff spot and are trying to make a push. Will their additions at the deadline coupled with a healthier roster be enough to make a run at a championship?</p>

        <div class="quote">That was embarrassing today. It's not acceptable. For a team that is fighting for the playoffs, to show up like that and play like that, it's not acceptable. It doesn't matter if you win or lose the game, it's how you win or lose the game. And that's not acceptable.
